## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Here's how you can help:

### Research Contributions
- Literature reviews on binary neural networks
- Mathematical analysis of binary representations
- Benchmark datasets and baselines

### Engineering Contributions
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Performance optimizations
- New evaluation metrics
- Documentation improvements

### Before Contributing

1. **Check Phase Status**: Phase 1 is frozen. Core logic changes require explicit approval.
2. **Run Tests**: All 157 tests must pass (`pytest -q`)
3. **Maintain Determinism**: Same seed must produce identical outputs
4. **Follow Code Style**: Match existing conventions

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run the test suite
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description
