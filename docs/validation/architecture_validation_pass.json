  "verdict": "PASS",
  "summary": "The Phase 1 architecture is tightly scoped around H1, with clear module boundaries, explicit bit conventions, and binding config/result schemas. Dataflow and error handling are fully specified, and the test plan covers correctness, determinism, regression, and basic systems sanity. It is suitable to freeze as the spec before any /engineer_binaryllm work.",
  "critical_flaws": [],
  "required_fixes": [],
  "math_validation": "The plan correctly instantiates the math from binaryllm_report_v2: binarization uses a sign (and optional scaled-sign) operator consistent with §3.1, with an explicit convention {-1,+1} internal and {-1→0,+1→1} for storage. L2 normalization is mandated by default for H1 experiments, aligning with the random hyperplane and Hamming–cosine relationships in §3.3–3.4. The config and tests explicitly enforce code_bits and projection_type choices compatible with the H1 setting and do not assume 1-bit representations are near-lossless, in line with the rate–distortion argument in §3.5.",
  "literature_alignment": "The design is grounded in the validated report: H1 is the central target, with explicit neighbor-overlap and retrieval metrics as in §5.3 and §7. Binary embeddings are produced via random or prelearned projections consistent with binary embedding theory (Jacques et al.), and similarity metrics directly compare Hamming vs cosine as outlined in the report. Auxiliary classification is clearly marked as non-core to H1 and framed as exploratory, avoiding any claim beyond the hypotheses in binaryllm_report_v2.",
  "feasibility": "Structurally, all components are implementable with standard Python + numerical libraries: dataset catalog + IO, pure-CPU projection/binarization, 64-bit packing, and retrieval/similarity metrics are straightforward and testable. The bit-packing layout (64-bit, LSB-first, row-major, 8-byte alignment) is compatible with future CUDA XNOR+popcount kernels on NVIDIA GPUs and does not rely on nonexistent 1-bit tensor-core modes. Instrumentation of binarization_time_ms and packing_time_ms provides enough early systems signal without over-engineering Phase 1, and the config/result schemas plus golden tests make the experiment pipeline reproducible and evolvable.",
  "novelty_score": "N2",
  "integrity_flags": [
    "Maintain strict discipline that all Phase 1 configs include hypotheses: [\"H1\"] and that future hypotheses are only added with corresponding research updates.",
    "Ensure dataset_catalog is kept in sync with any real datasets/encoders introduced later; drift here would undermine test and experiment assumptions.",
    "When adding new metrics or fields to the result schema, update both logging and tests simultaneously to preserve backward compatibility and regression guarantees.",
    "Monitor that the auxiliary classification module does not expand into a general training framework; it must remain evaluation-only to respect Phase 1 scope."
